She also emphasized that journalists from Vedomosti had not contacted her for comment before releasing the article.\xa0</p>, <p>Two women have participated in presidential elections in modern Russian history. In 2000, Ella Pamfilova, representing the parliamentary bloc For Civil Dignity, received 1.01 percent of votes, while in 2004 Irina Khakamada of the Union of Rightist Forces party gained 3.84 percent.</p>, <p>In April last year, Putin said that he considered it possible that a woman could become Russian president, adding that women could tackle many problems better than men.</p>, <p>So far, three people have announced their intention to run for the presidency in 2018. All three are men: the founder of the liberal Yabloko party, Grigory Yavlinsky, the head of the nationalist populist party LDPR, Vladimir Zhirinovsky, and anti-corruption activist Aleksey Navalny. The latter, however, is technically barred from running under Russian law because he is currently serving a five-year suspended jail sentence that will not expire before the next election.</p>, <p>Incumbent President Putin gave the first public indication that he will run for a new term in early August, when he promised a group of Siberian villagers that he would think about such an option in reply to their request to register as a candidate.</p>][<p>According to a recent poll conducted by the Public Opinion Foundation, 77 percent of Russians who live outside of Moscow would prefer this situation to remain unchanged.

The decision could be taken based on climate, ethnic and cultural conditions in a certain region.</p>, <p>Dengin emphasized that the postponement of the school year could help \u201cto use the warm season more effectively for children\u2019s recreation.\u201d\xa0 He also said that the bill allows the regional authorities to either move the end of the school year one month forward or leave it where it is and force schools to adjust timetabled contact hours.\xa0</p>, <p>The lawmaker also said that requests for such bill had been coming in from various Russian regions for some time. However, the actual drafting of the bill happened about a week after media reported that a number of Moscow schools were considering cancellation of the September 1 events because this year they coincided with the Muslim holiday Eid al-Adha which is better known in Russia under the Turkic name Kurban Bayram. The schools in question were located near Moscow\u2019s central mosque, and during this holiday tens of thousands of believers gather around it for a mass prayer.</p>, <p>A spokesman for Russia\u2019s Council of Muftis told reporters that the moving of the start of the school year had been proposed by the Moscow Education Department, and Moscow's deputy mayor in charge of security and information policy said that the authorities sought convenience for teachers, schoolchildren and their parents, as well as for Muslim worshipers.</p>, <p>The authorities of the predominantly Muslim region of Bashkiria reported earlier this month that the start of the school year will be postponed in its capital city Ufa, also because the Eid al-Adha holiday clashes with September 1 this year.</p>, <p>However, Russian senators oppose the idea. One of the members of the Upper House Committee for Education, Science and Culture, senator Oleg Kazakovtsev told reporters that some traditions should not be changed, adding that Russia was a secular society.\xa0 Another member of the same committee, Senator Liliya Gumerova told reporters that the bill contradicted the efforts of the parliament and the government to introduce a single \u201ceducational space\u201d throughout the country.</p>][<p>\u201c<em>I would like to emphasize that apart from its anti-terrorist components, the Zapad-2017 (West-2017) exercise is of a purely defensive character</em>,\u201d Lieutenant-General Aleksandr Fomin told reporters on Tuesday.</p>, <p>\u201c<em>For several months major mass media outlets around the world have been disturbing the public with myths about the Russian military threat. Politicians followed suit. They invent the most unbelievable ways for the events to develop, some even allege that Zapad-2017 could become a launchpad for a future attack with subsequent occupation of Lithuania, Poland or Ukraine. None of these paradoxical theories has anything to do with reality, as has been repeatedly stated by Russian and Belarusian officials</em>,\u201d Fomin\xa0 said.</p>, <p>He also noted that the location for the exercises, in Belarus and western Russian, was not significant for the scenario of the drills. \u201c<em>According to our estimates, the situation described in the scenario can develop in any part of the world</em>,\u201d he said.</p>, <p>Fomin told the press that both Russia and Belarus had duly warned OSCE member states about the plans to hold joint military exercises, and had invited international monitors to the event.</p>, <p>\u201c<em>These are ordinary, pre-planned joint exercises, not some sort of aggression as they are presented by certain nations. I think all these discussions and fearmongering make little sense. Everything will be open and friendly, as usual</em>,\u201d he stated.</p>, <p>The Russian comments came soon after the US special representative to Ukraine, Kurt Volker, said that because of the Zapad-2017 drills Western nations must cooperate more on developing their own security system and be prepared for all possible scenarios.</p>, <p>The Belarusian Defense Ministry also reacted to the allegations that the drills pose a threat, calling the accusations \u201c<em>inadequate</em>\u201d and \u201c<em>incorrect</em>.\u201d It also emphasized that all Russian military units engaged in Zapad-2017 will leave Belarus by September 30.\xa0</p>, <p>The Zapad-2017 international strategic military exercises will take place on September 14-20 in Belarus and three regions in the western part of Russia.</p>, <p>The respective militaries cite the main objective of the training as testing the operational compatibility of the two nations\u2019 headquarters, as well as interaction between the newest systems of troop control and weapons. About 70 aircraft, 250 tanks, 200 cannon and rocket artillery systems, 10 ships and about 12,000 servicemen will participate, Fomin told reporters at a Tuesday press conference.</p>, <p>Also in mid-September, the United States is planning joint military exercises with Finland near the Baltic coast of Sweden, US media reported, quoting a representative of the National Security Council.</p>][<p>EFJ General Secretary Ricardo Gutierrez told RIA Novosti that after<a href="http://www.coe.int/en/web/media-freedom/all-alerts/-/soj/alert/28275622"> the alert appeared on the website</a>, it would be circulated among the ambassadors of all Council of Europe member states. Gutierrez also said that he expected the Council\u2019s Secretary General Thorbjorn Jagland to invite Estonian representatives to give an explanation for the scandal.</p>, <p>The Estonian Presidency of the Council of the European Union refused accreditation to three reporters from the Rossiya Segodnya international information agency who wanted to cover an informal meeting of EU foreign ministers, scheduled to take place in the Estonian capital Tallinn on September 7-8. Ricardo Gutierrez described this situation as an attack on media freedom, and Rossiya Segodnya Editor-in-Chief Margarita Simonyan thanked the head of Europe\u2019s largest journalists\u2019 organization for his support.</p>, <p>This is just the latest in a series of incidents in which Russian reporters have been subjected to discrimination and obstruction by agencies of the Estonian state. In April this year, two journalists working for Russian TV channel REN-TV were refused entry to the country at Tallinn Airport on the grounds that they did not have papers confirming the purpose of their visit. In October 2015, Estonian authorities detained and deported a crew of the All-Russian State Television and Radio Corporation without explanation, and in September 2015 Estonia refused accreditation and entry to a reporter representing the Rossiya Segodnya agency, also without giving a reason for doing so.</p>][<p>The presidential order on accepting the Russian government\u2019s proposal to join the cooperation agreement on fighting crime in the sphere of digital technology was posted on the official Russian web portal for legal information on Monday.</p>, <p>\u201c<em>In the course of treaty negotiations, the Russian Interior Ministry should be allowed to introduce changes to the document that are not of fundamental character</em>,\u201d reads a part of the order.</p>, <p>The first agreement on cooperation in countering cybercrime was signed in the Belarusian capital Minsk in 2001. Now that more than a decade has passed it is obvious that the document needs adjustments and in late 2014 the parliamentary assembly of the CIS passed a new model law on information and data security which was then forwarded to national parliaments for scrutiny. The main objective of the model law is introducing single definitions to various forms and aspects of cybercrime that would allow police in various CIS countries to coordinate their operations effectively.\xa0</p>, <p>In April this year Russian media reported that the Foreign Ministry had prepared a new UN convention on countering digital crime because it believes the current document could potentially threaten the sovereignty of independent states. The draft has already been presented to UN experts.</p>, <p>Moscow sees the new draft as a necessary replacement for the Budapest Convention of 2001, developed by the Council of Europe.</p>, <p>Russia is the only nation participating in the Council of Europe not to have signed the Budapest Convention. The main reason for this is that paragraph 32 of the convention allows trans-border access to stored computer data during cyber-crime investigations by the intelligence services of various nations.</p>, <p>Earlier this month Russian Prosecutor General Yuri Chaika estimated the damage inflicted by cyber-criminals in Russia in the first 6 months of 2017 at over US$18 million. He also said that the number of crimes committed in Russia with use of modern data technology increased sixfold in just three years \u2013 from 11000 in 2013 to 66000 in 2016 with authorities having already registered 40000 such crimes in the first six months of 2017.</p>, <p>\u201c<em>The broad spectrum of illegal actions committed with the help of the internet and communication devices inflict considerable material damage and also target the security of the state</em>,\u201d Chaika said as he addressed the summit of the heads of BRICS nation prosecutor services.</p>][<p>\u201c<em>The US special envoy is playing on Kiev\u2019s side, which is not surprising.

Also this week Polish Prime Minister Beata Szydlo described this initiative as \u201c<em>a claim for justice</em>,\u201d and stated that \u201c<em>whoever has a different view \u2026 should first look at history and thoroughly learn what was happening on Polish soil during the war</em>.\u201d</p>, <p>Poland\u2019s right to German post-war compensation was waived by the then Communist government in 1953, in order to \u201ccontribute to solving the Germany question in the spirit of democracy and peace.\u201d However, after Poland\u2019s return to capitalism and democracy many of its leading politicians claimed that the waiver was imposed on their country by the Soviet regime, and therefore should be reconsidered.</p>, <p>In 2004 the Sejm passed a key resolution declaring that Poland has not received sufficient reparations\xa0 for the material and non-material losses caused by German aggression and occupation during WWII.

In the latest exchange that took place in early August Ulrike Demmer, a spokesperson for the German government, said that while her country assumed political, moral and financial responsibility for WWII, the question of restitution was closed.

Russia has also signed the Additional Protocol to the Convention on the Prevention of Terrorism. Ivan Soltanovsky, Permanent Representative of the Russian Federation to the Council of Europe, spoke to RT and Sputnik about Russia\u2019s priorities in these areas.</p>, <p><strong>RT:</strong><em>How important is it for the Russian Federation to join the convention on countering terrorist financing?</em></p>, <p><strong>Ivan Soltanovsky:</strong> In the early 2000s the World faced the unprecedented surge in international terrorism. Terrorist organizations gained considerable capacities and support. One of the major causes was their ability to gather large resources through both criminal and legal activities and donations of various NGOs. It is evident that the efforts of single states were insufficient to cope with this challenge.</p>, <p>At this time, the Council of Europe developed the Convention on Laundering, Search, Seizure and Confiscation of the Proceeds from Crime and on the Financing of Terrorism. Russia ratified this convention in August this year. This convention establishes the mechanism which can prevent terrorist attacks by cutting terrorist financing. Russia gets an additional capability to disrupt the financing of foreign terrorist fighters in its territory.</p>, <p><strong>RT:</strong><em>The Council of Europe does not limit itself to fighting terrorism financing. What can you say about the Additional Protocol to the Convention on the Prevention of Terrorism?</em></p>, <p><strong>IS:</strong> Indeed, we develop different mechanisms to combat terrorism in the Council of Europe. Unfortunately, terrorism continues to evolve, it takes new forms and adopts new methods. The Syrian crisis has given rise to so-called \u201cjihad-tourism\u201d. States encounter the problem of prosecuting their citizens for terrorist activities which have been committed in another country. It is also critical to stop foreign terrorist fighters in their own territory. The Additional Protocol to the Convention on the Prevention of Terrorism which was signed by the Russian Federation on July 27 is a response to these challenges. This document criminalizes trips to other countries to participate in terrorist organizations as well as the organization and financing of such trips even if such activity is not aimed at committing terrorist attacks per se.</p>, <p><strong><a href="https://www.rt.com/news/383729-small-scale-attacks-coming/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">READ MORE: Europe should brace itself for more attacks \u2013 top EU anti-terrorism official to RT</a></strong></p>, <p>I would like to say something about the Convention on the Prevention of Terrorism of 2005. Our country initiated its development and was one of the first signatories. One of its most important features is that it enshrines the principle \u201cextradite or prosecute\u201d as well as criminalizes public incitement to commit terrorist offences, recruitment for terrorism and training for terrorism. The \u2018extradite or prosecute\u2019 principle means that a party to this convention is obliged to initiate a prosecution against a suspected terrorist whom it denies to extradite to another party of the convention. The terrorists should be unable to find a safe haven anywhere.</p>, <p><strong>RT:</strong><em>Could you please talk about the activities of the Committee of Experts on Terrorism which is the main specialized body of the Council of Europe on counterterrorism?</em></p>, <p><strong>IS:</strong> Unfortunately, the Russian Federation has gained great experience in combatting terrorism in recent years. And this experience unequivocally demonstrates that antiterrorism is much more efficient if it is implemented in cooperation, if competent authorities exchange information on a regular basis and share the best practices. This is why the Russian Federation is active in the Committee of Experts on Terrorism or CODEXTER. This Committee coordinates antiterrorism in the Council of Europe, analyzes international counterterrorism norms, standards and practices and overcomes their shortcomings.</p>, <p>CODEXTER also cooperates closely with other international institutions and organizations such as the UN Counter-Terrorism Committee Executive Directorate, the UN Office on Drugs and Crime, the Organization on Security and Cooperation in Europe, the European Union and the Global Counterterrorism Forum. Thus, CODEXTER promotes trust-based relations between competent authorities of different countries. This simplifies international counterterrorist cooperation, accelerates the resolution of many issues and it will be no exaggeration to say that human lives often depend on this.</p>, <p><strong>RT:</strong><em>In 2015, the Council of Europe adopted the Action Plan \u201cThe fight against violent extremism and radicalization leading to terrorism\u201d. What can you say about it?</em></p>, <p><strong>IS:</strong> We welcome integrated and systemic approach of the Council of Europe to counterterrorism. We consider the action plan which stipulates the priorities of antiterrorist activities of the Council of Europe for 2015-2017 against this background.</p>, <p>We are positive about the fact that this document focuses on terrorism prevention. We consider preventative work against radicalization in prisons to be very important. As both Russian and international experience demonstrates many terrorists become radicalized in prisons. Thus, relevant developments of the Council of Europe which are based on the best international practices are highly topical.</p>, <p><strong><a href="https://www.rt.com/uk/395493-jihadi-jails-prison-terrorists/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">READ MORE: \u2018Jihadist jails\u2019 set up within British prisons to isolate extremists</a></strong></p>, <p>Recent events show that terrorists acting alone pose all the greater threat. The plan envisages that the Council of Europe elaborates a recommendation on terrorists acting alone given the experience obtained by a number of countries. No doubts that such a document will be very useful for the Russian Federation.</p>, <p><strong>RT:</strong><em>What could you say in conclusion before we move on? How would you evaluate current results of antiterrorism in the Council of Europe?</em></p>, <p><strong>IS:</strong> Counterterrorism has become one of the main activities of the Council of Europe. It has found its own niche in the global fight against terrorism. The main efforts of the Council of Europe are focused on counterterrorism through legal, social and cultural means.</p>, <p><strong><a href="https://www.rt.com/news/400910-belgium-terrorism-cases-opened/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">READ MORE: Belgium opens 189 terrorism cases since start of 2017, focus on \u2018homegrown\u2019 extremists \u2013 reports</a></strong></p>, <p>I think that multilateralism is a distinctive feature of counterterrorism in the Council of Europe. We obtain a capability to thwart international terrorism, to cut its foreign financing, prosecute crimes committed abroad, request terrorists\u2019 extradition from other countries. So the Council of Europe contributes to a common European legal framework of law and order area and facilitates European democratic stability. We are satisfied that the Council of Europe has managed to retain a depoliticized and result-oriented cooperation in this area in current difficult political climate.</p>, <p>We have always supported stronger antiterrorist cooperation. Unfortunately, practically all the Member-States have encountered the problem of terrorism. In this context, our country advocates stronger human and financial potential for the Council of Europe in this area. We are sure that this will increase antiterrorist capabilities of the Council of Europe.</p>, <p><strong>RT:</strong><em>Also on the radar of the Council of Europe\u2026 is European legal regulation in sport. What could you say about the activities of the Council of Europe in this sphere?</em></p>, <p><strong>IS:</strong> Sporting issues are gaining an ever-growing importance in the dimension of humanitarian cooperation in the Council of Europe. One of the reasons for this is that the organization seeks to become a major developer of international sports standards. I believe that the Council of Europe has the necessary potential to succeed here if it keeps current balanced and depoliticized approach. I am convinced that the Council of Europe can play a role of utmost importance in protecting sportsmen from discrimination in different international sports organizations. The European Court of Human Rights could deal with these issues. The reasons are obvious. The breaches of the European Convention on Human Rights are more often than not evident.</p>, <p><strong>RT:</strong><em>This August, Russia ratified the Council of Europe Convention on an Integrated Safety, Security and Service Approach at Football Matches and Other Sports Events. What are the priorities of the Russian Federation in this area in the Council of Europe?</em></p>, <p><strong>IS:</strong> I am sure that the ratification of the Convention will help Russia to prepare even better for the upcoming Football World Cup. Hooliganism at sports events has a trans-border effect. The convention will aid in establishing a new system of ensuring the safety of such events. This step demonstrates Russia\u2019s serious attitude towards both implementation and the development of new sports standards in this area.</p>, <p>This is completely true for fighting doping. A bilateral anti-doping action plan was signed by Russia and the Council of Europe in May 2016. It is aimed at overcoming the doping scandal with our country. As a co-author of this plan the World Anti-Doping Agency also approved it.</p>, <p>Its systematic and successful implementation has borne fruit. WADA has recently allowed the Russian Anti-Doping Agency to take tests (although under control of the colleagues form the UK) and published a favorable report on the status of the Russian anti-doping system. This plan is unique because it provides for establishing the highest anti-doping standards. After it has been implemented, Russia will become the most advanced country in this sphere and set the bar for other countries.</p>][<p><strong><a href="https://www.rt.com/news/396370-russia-prosecutor-general-veselnitskaya/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">READ MORE: Russian Prosecutor General\u2019s Office denies link to Trump Jr. meeting with Russian lawyer (EXCLUSIVE)</a></strong></p>, <p><strong>RT: Some foreign media wrote about the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya which reportedly took place last June, and possible involvement of the Russian Prosecutor General\u2019s Office in brokering the meeting. How would you comment on this information?</strong></p>, <p><strong>Denis Grunis, head of the International Cooperation Department for Major Cases at the Office of International Legal Cooperation of Russia\u2019s Prosecutor General's Office:</strong> I would not want to comment on something that is totally untrue. You have to understand that the Office of the Prosecutor General does not share information with individuals in the US. Such contacts can only happen through official channels \u2013 as stipulated by international agreements \u2013 and after a formal query is submitted by a prosecution agency.</p>, <p>This is exactly what we told your foreign colleagues \u2013 and we had about a dozen major Western media outlets asking us to comment. Interestingly enough, they did not publish any of our comments.</p>, <p><strong>RT: So you are saying that the Prosecutor General\u2019s Office could not have sent Veselnitskaya?</strong></p>, <p><strong>Denis Grunis:</strong> It is insane to think that the Prosecutor General\u2019s Office would use a private lawyer to transfer information. Let me explain how this communication between our agency and the US usually happens.</p>, <p>In 1999, Russia and the US entered into the Treaty on Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters, and it is still valid.</p>, <p>This treaty states that any exchange of information about criminal cases is done through the countries\u2019 official agencies \u2013 the Russian Prosecutor General\u2019s Office and the US Department of Justice. So if we need to share information with our American colleagues, we send it to the Justice Department, after processing it in full compliance with the Treaty.</p>, <p>There is a direct channel of communication between our agencies. For instance, in 2015, we sent 109 queries to the US, asking for legal assistance in criminal matters, and received 35 such queries from our American colleagues.</p>, <p>The Russian Prosecutor General\u2019s Office is in constant communication with the American colleagues \u2013 we hold video conferences and meet with the law enforcement employees of the US embassy in Moscow. These contacts allow us to coordinate practical steps that we take under this Treaty.</p>, <p>The Prosecutor General\u2019s Office views this cooperation with the US as quite an efficient mechanism.</p>, <p><strong>RT: So the Prosecutor General\u2019s Office can\xa0share information with\xa0the Justice Department. How does that work?</strong></p>, <p><strong>Denis Grunis:</strong>\xa0I\u2019ll give you some examples. Even though we have no extradition treaty, we still succeed in ensuring the inevitability of punishment for those who commit crimes via sharing information and evidence that DOJ needs. For instance, upon the query from the US Department of Justice, a Russian citizen named Rakosiy was charged with murder of two people in New York in 2011. The court sentenced him to 19 years in prison.</p>, <p>Last March, the California Central District Court sentenced a US citizen, Mr. Abramov, to life in prison for pedophilia. Justice was served, because we shared evidence with the US law enforcement.\xa0</p>, <p><strong>RT: You said that there is no extradition treaty \u2013 is that the only problem hindering the cooperation between the prosecution agencies of the two countries?</strong></p>, <p><strong>Denis Grunis:</strong> We appreciate our colleagues\u2019 level of professionalism and respect them. But at the same time, we have to admit that in some areas the Americans are not as eager to work with us as we would hope. As an example, I can mention investigation of economic crimes.</p>, <p>In Russia, we are at the final stages of the investigation into the illegal acquisition of 200 million Gazprom shares, tax evasion and deliberate bankruptcy of a number of companies.</p>, <p>The investigators had questions for an international group that included the Ziff brothers, William Browder, and Jamison Firestone. These foreign nationals headed up Ziff Brothers Investments, a US investment fund that used offshore companies to transfer money to the accounts of Russian shell corporations. Eventually, this scheme was applied to acquire the Gazprom shares at St. Petersburg and Moscow Exchanges in violation of the presidential order that regulated Gazprom share sale procedures at the time.</p>, <p>Then in 2006, all assets (Gazprom shares and dividends) were funneled out of the affiliated Russian companies. The companies failed to pay 1 billion rubles in taxes and were dismantled, while their assets (at least 1 billion dollars) were transferred to Cypriot companies and then, after a very short period of time, to US companies, in the same manner.</p>, <p>By the way, according to some media reports, Ziff Brothers Investments financed the US Democratic Party.</p>, <p><strong>RT: Have you shared this information with your American colleagues?</strong></p>, <p><strong>Denis Grunis:</strong> Yes, we have. Back in March 2016, we met with representatives of the US Embassy in Moscow, including some FBI operatives. We officially informed them that in the course of the investigation we had found certain information that showed that those people and organizations could have violated not only Russian, but also American tax and financial regulations.</p>, <p>The American delegation was headed by Mr. Godfrey, head of the political section and the third most important official in the US Embassy [in Russia]. We stressed that we might be talking about a cross-border organized criminal group. According to the information we have, it is de-facto led by Browder. We warned that the economic crimes committed by this group are notable for their sophistication. We said we did not rule out the possibility that the investigation might be hampered by the political forces in the US who could have received funding from this organization.\xa0\xa0</p>, <p>The US Embassy delegation promised to inform Washington about this issue in every detail, since they understand how sensitive it is. They advised us to relay the information we had about the potentially illegal activities on the US territory in a separate query so that it could be used to conduct an investigation in the US. They assured us that the query would be reviewed and handled with its importance in mind.</p>, <p>In May 2016, the Office of the Prosecutor General officially declared its intention to contact the US law enforcement agencies on this issue. In July, all the files, several volumes of them, were sent to the US Department of Justice. We also asked our US counterparts to carry out a number of investigative actions on the US territory, including interviewing the witnesses and seizure of documents.</p>, <p><strong>RT: What response did you get from your American counterparts?</strong></p>, <p><strong>Denis Grunis:</strong> Not the kind we expected, unfortunately. At first, our counterparts told us they were reviewing the files they had received. They assured us they would be very thorough and involve various experts. In early February 2017, after numerous reminders and discussions during video conferences and phone calls, we were told that working on our query might interfere with one of the investigations conducted on the US territory. As far as we know, the investigation and legal proceedings mentioned have nothing to do with the files we sent and have been completed by now.</p>, <p><strong>RT: Where do things stand now?</strong></p>, <p><strong>Denis Grunis:</strong>\xa0Our query regarding potentially illegal actions of a cross-border criminal group that includes the Ziff brothers, William Browder and Jamison Firestone, remains unanswered. We have not received the evidence we need for our investigation. Our American counterparts have conducted no inquiry or investigation based on the information we sent.</p>, <p><strong>RT: Why do you think that is? Could politics have played a part in it, just like you warned your counterparts it might\xa0in May last year?</strong></p>, <p><strong>Denis Grunis:</strong> I wouldn\u2019t rule that out. Nevertheless, we continue to cooperate with our American counterparts and hope for a response to our query. Neutralizing this criminal group is first and foremost in the US interests, since it operates predominantly on US soil. \xa0</p>][<p><strong></strong></p>, <p><strong>Le Figaro:</strong> A very good afternoon. Thank you very much for agreeing to answer questions from Le Figaro. I would also like to thank you for meeting with us here, in a classroom at the Russian Cultural Center. Once again, thank you for granting this interview.</p>, <p>You came to France in order to open an exhibition that marks 300 years since the establishment of diplomatic ties between Russia and France. There have been highs and lows in the relations between the two countries. What is your perspective on the current state of these relations?</p>, <p><strong>Vladimir Putin: </strong>It is true that President Macron invited me to take part in the opening of the exhibition. However, let me tell you straight away that the relations between Russia and France have a much longer history and much deeper roots, as the French President and I both mentioned on several occasions today. In fact, the younger daughter of Yaroslav the Wise, one of Russia\u2019s Grand Princesses, Anna, came here in the 11th century to marry King Henry I of France. She was actually called Anna of Rus, Queen of France. Her son Philip I of France was the founder of two European royal houses, the Valois and the Bourbons, and the latter rules in Spain to this day. This goes to say that the roots of our relations go much deeper, although over the last 300 years they did pick up momentum. This is true. I very much hope that today\u2019s event, the exhibition and my talks with President Macron will give a new impetus to these relations.</p>, <p><strong>LF:</strong> Mr President, what is your vision of Peter the Great, who came to Versailles in 1717 to establish diplomatic relations?</p>, <p><strong>VP:</strong> As I have said to my French colleague and our French friends today, Peter the Great was above all a reformer, a man who not only implemented the best and the most up-to-date practices, but also was undoubtedly a patriot, who fought to secure for Russia the place it deserved in international affairs. But above all, he was committed to reforming his country, making it modern, resilient and forward-looking. He succeeded in many, if not all, of his undertakings. He focused on research, education, culture, military affairs and statehood, leaving an immense legacy that Russia has been relying on to this day, let alone the fact that he founded my hometown, St. Petersburg, which was the capital of Russia for many years.</p>, <p><strong>LF:</strong> You said that you recently met with Mr. Macron. Did you have any expectations from the first meeting? You said that it is important to overcome the stage of mistrust. Is it over now?</p>, <p>As for the main issue, the sanctions, can you say you reached any kind of understanding?</p>, <p><strong>VP:</strong> At any meeting, in any contacts, at any events of this level, especially if it is the first contact, there are always expectations. If there are no expectations, it is pointless to hold meetings of this kind. I certainly had expectations this time. I wanted to get a closer look, to learn first-hand the position of the incoming President of the French Republic on the key issues on the international agenda and on the development of bilateral relations.</p>, <p>As the newly elected president takes office, he certainly has his own view of things, of bilateral relations, of international politics. Overall, I would say it is a very pragmatic view. We certainly have points for rapprochement, for joint work in key areas.</p>, <p><strong>LF:</strong> The implementation of the Minsk Agreements on Ukraine seems to have reached a deadlock. Have you managed to achieve any progress with President Macron toward the resolution of this conflict?</p>, <p><strong>VP:</strong> Progress in resolving any conflict, including the conflict in southeast Ukraine, can be achieved first and foremost by the conflicting parties. This conflict is internal \u2013 a Ukrainian conflict primarily. It occurred after an unconstitutional forceful seizure of power in Kiev in 2014. This is the source of all problems. The most important thing to do is to find the strength to negotiate with all the conflicting parties, and above all, I am confident that as they say, the ball is in the court of the official Kiev authorities. First of all, they must take care of implementing the Minsk agreements.</p>, <p><strong>LF:</strong> What could help achieve progress in this area? Can Russia put forth an initiative that will bring about peace?</p>, <p><strong>VP:</strong> This is what we keep talking about. We believe that the main condition is to withdraw the armed forces from the contact line. This is the first thing that must be done. The withdrawal has been completed in two areas, but this goal has not been reached in the third area. The Ukrainian authorities say this cannot be done because of the shooting there. But shooting will not stop unless troops and heavy weaponry pull back. Heavy weaponry must be withdrawn. This is a key priority.</p>, <p>The second goal in the political sphere is to put into practice, at long last, the law on the special status of these regions, which the Ukrainian parliament has adopted. The law has been adopted but has not come into effect.</p>, <p>The law on amnesty has been passed, but President Poroshenko has not signed it. The Minsk Agreements stipulate the social and economic rehabilitation in the self-proclaimed republics. Instead of doing this, Kiev has blockaded these territories. The blockade was initiated by the radicals who blocked the railway lines. At first, the Ukrainian president denounced their actions and said that he would restore order. However, he failed. Instead of continuing his efforts, he officially joined the blockade and issued an executive order to this effect. Can we speak of changes for the better in this situation? Regrettably, we have not seen any so far.</p>, <p><strong>LF:</strong> Let us forget about Eastern Europe for a minute and talk about the Middle East, primarily Syria. After Russia\u2019s military intervention in September 2015, what do you think are the main solutions for Syria to get out of this long-term war?</p>, <p><strong>VP:</strong> First, I would like to note the constructive approach of Turkey and Iran, and, of course, the Syrian government, which, together with Russia, have managed to achieve a ceasefire. The ceasefire would not have been possible without the so-called Syrian armed opposition. It was the first and very important step toward peace.</p>, <p>Another step, which is no less important, is the agreement on establishing the so-called de-escalation zones. Currently there are four such zones. We believe this is an extremely important milestone on the way to peace, if I can phrase it this way, because it is impossible to talk about a political settlement without stopping the bloodshed. Now, in my opinion, we are all facing a different task, which is technically and I would even say technologically completing the creation of these de-escalation zones, agreeing on their boundaries and how government bodies will function there, as well as how these de-escalation zones will communicate with the outside world.</p>, <p>Incidentally, President Macron mentioned this when he was speaking about humanitarian aid convoys. Generally, I believe that the French president is right and it is one of the points of contact where we can cooperate with our French colleagues. Once the de-escalation zones are formalized, I do hope that at least some elements of cooperation will begin between the government and those people who will control the de-escalation zones.</p>, <p>I really hope (and what I am about to say is very important) that these zones do not become a prototype for the future territorial division in Syria. On the contrary, I expect that these de-escalation zones, if peace is established, and the people who will be controlling them, will cooperate with the official Syrian authorities. This is how an environment of basic interaction and cooperation can and must be built. The next step is a purely political reconciliation and, if possible, the development of constitutional regulations, a constitution and holding elections.</p>, <p><strong>LF:</strong> Indeed, Russia and the other parties differ on the Syrian issue regarding primarily the fate of Bashar al-Assad, whom the Western countries have accused of using chemical weapons against his own people.</p>, <p>Mr. President, can you envision Syria\u2019s political future without Bashar al-Assad?</p>, <p><strong>VP:</strong> I do not think I have the right to determine the political future of Syria, be it with or without al-Assad. This is for the Syrians themselves to decide. Nobody has the right to claim the rights that belong to the people of another country. This is the first thing I wanted to say.</p>, <p>Do you have an additional question?</p>, <p><strong>LF:</strong> Yes, I do. You say that this is not your decision. However, this does not mean that Syria\u2019s future is possible without al-Assad, does it?</p>, <p><strong>VP:</strong> As I have said, this is for the Syrian people to decide. You have mentioned allegations about the use of chemical weapons by the Syrian government. When the attack happened, we called on our American partners \u2013 and everyone else who considers this to be expedient \u2013 to send inspectors to the airfield from which the planes that dropped chemical bombs allegedly took off. If chemical weapons were used by President al-Assad\u2019s official agencies, modern verification equipment would certainly find traces of this at the airfield. For certain. These traces would be found in the aircraft and at the airfield. However, everyone refused to conduct such an inspection.</p>, <p>We also proposed sending inspectors to the site of the alleged chemical attack. But they refused as well, claiming that it was dangerous. Why is this dangerous if the attack was delivered in an area where peaceful civilians live and the healthy part of the armed opposition is deployed? In my opinion, the accusations have been made for the sole purpose of justifying the use of additional measures, including military ones, against al-Assad. That is all. There is no proof that al-Assad has used chemical weapons. We firmly believe that that this is a provocation. President al-Assad did not use chemical weapons.</p>, <p><strong>LF:</strong> Do you remember what President Macron said about the red lines with regard to chemical weapons? Do you agree with him?</p>, <p><strong>VP:</strong> Yes, I do.</p>, <p>Moreover, I believe that this issue should be addressed on a broader scale. President Macron shares this view. No matter who uses chemical weapons against people and organizations, the international community must formulate a common policy and find a solution that would make the use of such weapons impossible for anyone.</p>, <p><strong>LF:</strong> After Donald Trump was elected president of the United States, many people spoke about a new era in Russian-US relations. However, these relations do not seem to have made a new start. The NATO leaders spoke about the Russian threat at their summit last week.</p>, <p>Are you disappointed by the US attitude?</p>, <p><strong>VP:</strong> No, I am not. We had no special expectations. The US president is steering a traditional US policy. Of course, we remember that during his election campaign, and also after he was elected and assumed office, President Trump spoke about his intention to normalize the relationship with Russia and said that it cannot be any worse. We remember this. However, we also see and realize that the political situation in the United States is influenced by those who have lost the elections but refuse to accept their defeat, and who continue to use the anti-Russia card and various allegations most actively in the political infighting. This is why we are in no hurry, we are ready to wait, yet we strongly hope that Russian-US relations will become normal again sometime in the future.</p>, <p>As for increasing\u2026</p>, <p><strong>LF:</strong> In a perfect world, what would you expect the United States to do to improve relations with Russia?</p>, <p><strong>VP:</strong> There is no such thing as a perfect world, and there is no subjunctive mood in politics.</p>, <p>I would like to answer the second part of your question, regarding plans to increase military spending by 2 percent or more. It is a fact that the US defense budget is larger than the defense budgets of all other countries taken together. This is why I understand the US president when he says that his NATO allies should take over part of this burden. It is a pragmatic and understandable approach.</p>, <p>However, what attracted my attention is that the NATO leaders spoke at their summit about a desire to improve relations with Russia. Then why are they increasing their military spending? Whom are they planning to fight against? I see an inner contradiction here, although this is not our business. Let NATO decide who will pay and how much. We have our own defense to deal with, and we are working to ensure it is reliable and with a view to the future. We feel confident.</p>, <p><strong>LF:</strong> However, regarding NATO, some of your neighbors want to ensure their security through NATO. Is this a sign of mistrust toward you, something that causes a scandalous attitude?</p>, <p><strong>VP:</strong> For us this is a sign that our partners in Europe and in the United States are, pardon me, pursuing a short-sighted policy. They do not have the habit of looking one step ahead. Our Western partners have lost this habit.</p>, <p>When the Soviet Union ceased to exist, Western politicians told us (it was not documented on paper but stated quite clearly) that NATO would not expand to the East. Some German politicians at the time even proposed creating a new security system in Europe that would involve the United States and, by the way, Russia.</p>, <p>If that had been done, we would not have the problems we have had in recent years, which is NATO\u2019s expansion to the East up to our borders, the advance of military infrastructure to our borders. Perhaps the United States would not have unilaterally withdrawn from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. This treaty was a cornerstone of current and future security. The missile defense facilities in Europe \u2013 in Poland and Romania \u2013 would not have been built, which, undoubtedly, creates a threat to our strategic nuclear forces and disrupts the strategic balance \u2013 an extremely dangerous development for international security. Perhaps all this would not have happened. But it did, and we cannot rewind history, it is not a movie.</p>, <p>We have to proceed from the current situation. In this respect, we need to think about what we want from the future. I think we all want security, peace, safety and cooperation. Therefore, we should not build up tensions or invent fictional threats from Russia, some hybrid warfare etc. You made these things up yourselves and now scare yourselves with them and even use them to plan your prospective policies. These policies have no prospects. The only possible future is in cooperation in all areas, including security issues.</p>, <p>What is the major security problem today? Terrorism. There are bombings in Europe, in Paris, in Russia, in Belgium. There is a war in the Middle East. This is the main concern. But no, let us keep speculating about the threat from Russia.</p>, <p><strong>LF:</strong> You are saying that more could be done regarding terrorism and Islamism. But what exactly should be done and what can Russia do? And why is it so hard to work with Europe to achieve these goals?</p>, <p><strong>VP:</strong> Ask Europe. We are willing to cooperate, as I said a while ago at the 70th anniversary of the United Nations, when I called on all countries to unite their efforts to fight terrorism. However, this is a very complex issue.</p>, <p>Look, after the Paris terrorist attack, a bloody and horrible event, President Hollande came to Russia and we agreed on cooperative actions. The Charles de Gaulle aircraft carrier approached the Syrian coast. Then, Francois [Hollande] headed to Washington, while the Charles de Gaulle left for the Suez Canal. So real cooperation with France ended before it even started. France is involved in operations there, but it is acting within the US-led coalition. Go figure who gives the orders, and who is not, who has a say, and what the agenda is. Russia is open to cooperation.</p>, <p>It was also very difficult to agree on these issues with the US. Incidentally, we have been seeing some shifts lately; and there are actual results. I spoke to President Trump on the telephone, and he supported the idea, in general, of creating de-escalation zones.</p>, <p>We are now considering how the interests of all the countries to the south of Syria can be best served, with consideration for the concerns of all the countries that face issues in this region. I am referring to Jordan, Israel and Syria itself. Of course, Russia is ready to heed what the United States and our European partners have to say. However, what we need is for the dialogue to be specific and concise, instead of empty talk about mutual claims and threats. There is a need for a real effort.</p>, <p><strong>LF: </strong>You are saying that they are the ones who need to decide and act, right?</p>, <p><strong>VP:</strong> That is exactly the way it is.</p>, <p><strong>LF:</strong> You have mentioned the United States. The allegations of Russia\u2019s interference in the US presidential race raised a political storm in Washington. Similar allegations were also voiced in France. What is your response, especially against the backdrop of recent developments in the US?</p>, <p><strong>VP:</strong> I have already commented on this issue many times. There was a question on this topic from one of your colleagues today. He put it very cautiously at the news conference, saying that \u2018there are allegations that Russian hackers\u2026\u2019 Who is making these allegations? Based on what? If these are just allegations, then these hackers could be from anywhere else and not necessarily from Russia. As President Trump once said, and I think that he was totally right when he said it could have been someone sitting on their bed or somebody intentionally inserted a flash drive with the name of a Russian national, or something like that. Anything is possible in this virtual world. Russia never engages in activities of this kind, and we do not need it. It makes no sense for us to do such things. What for?</p>, <p>I have already spoken to three US presidents. They come and go, but politics stays the same at all times. Do you know why? Because of the powerful bureaucracy. When a person is elected, they may have some ideas. Then people with briefcases arrive, well dressed, wearing dark suits, just like mine, except for the red tie, since they wear black or dark blue ones. These people start explaining how things are done. And instantly, everything changes. This is what happens with every administration.</p>, <p>Changing things is not easy, and I say this without any irony. It is not that someone does not want to, but because it is a hard thing to do. Take Obama, a forward-thinking man, a liberal, a democrat. Did he not pledge to shut down Guantanamo before his election? But did he do it? No, he did not. And may I ask why not? Did he not want to do it? He wanted to, I am sure he did, but it did not work out. He sincerely wanted to do it, but did not succeed, since it turned out to be very complicated. This is not the main issue, however, even though it is important, since it is hard to fathom that people have been walking there in chains for decades without trial or investigation. Can you imagine France or Russia acting this way? This would have been a disaster. But it is possible in the United States and continues to this day. This refers to the question on democracy, by the way.</p>, <p>I referred to this example just to show that it is not as simple as it may seem. That said, I am cautiously optimistic, and I think that we can and should be able to reach agreements on key issues.</p>, <p><strong>LF:</strong> You are saying that right now, the political storm in Washington rests on absolutely unsubstantiated allegations.</p>, <p><strong>VP:</strong> It is not based on allegations, but on the desire of those who lost the elections in the United States to at least improve their standing through anti-Russia attacks, by accusing Russia of interference. The people who lost the elections do not want to admit that they really lost, that the one who won was closer to the people and better understood what ordinary voters want. They are absolutely reluctant to admit this, and prefer deluding themselves and others into thinking it was not their fault, that their policy was correct, they did all the right things, but someone from the outside thwarted them. But it was not so. They just lost and they have to admit it.</p>, <p>When they do, I think it will be easier for us to work. However, the fact that this is being done using anti-Russia tools is not good, as it brings discord into international affairs. Let them argue among themselves, so they can prove who is stronger, who is better, who is smarter, who is more reliable and who sets a better policy for the country. Why involve third countries? This is very distressing. But it will pass, everything passes, and this will pass as well.</p>, <p><strong>LF:</strong> Mr. President, we are close to the end of our interview. Most of all I would like to ask you a question about 2018. This is the year of elections in Russia \u2013 presidential elections, and elections to the Federal Assembly. Could you tell us if you intend to run, or perhaps the opposition would be able to nominate someone in a democratic procedure? How do you see the development of this situation? You do want next year\u2019s campaign to unfold in a truly democratic environment, don\u2019t you? I am talking about 2018.</p>, <p><strong>VP:</strong> All the recent election campaigns in Russia have been in strict accordance with the Russian Constitution, in strict compliance. And I will make every effort to ensure that the 2018 election campaigns are conducted in the same way, I repeat, in strict accordance with the law and the Constitution. So anyone entitled to run, anyone who fulfils the relevant procedures prescribed by law, can and will participate, if they wish, in elections at all levels \u2013 to legislative assemblies, to parliament, and in presidential elections.</p>, <p>As for the candidates, it is still too early to talk about it.</p>, <p><strong>LF:</strong> Thank you. I hope we will see you soon. Thank you very much for sharing your views with Le Figaro.</p>][][][]{% endblock %}
